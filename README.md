The website is to help 65+ years old people to live a healthier and better life.

The Work I have done :
  1. I have analysed census_age.csv data to find nummber of 65+ age old citizens. That analysis is in "Age.IPYNB" in the Master branch.
  2. I have build website to showcase my idea to make 65+ years old people's lives easier using Flask, Bootstrap. The whole code and files of website is in Master branch of my repo.

The idea :
  1. Major priority is to make healthcare easily available to age old people. This will be done by alloting near by hospitals to senior citizens on the basis of their address.
  2. A community will be created of senior citizens who are sharing same hospitals. Via respective community they can build their own programs to have fun.
  3. Thus the main idea is to connect 65+ age old people to nearby hospitals and provide them company of their age people so that they will not feel alone.




Note : 
1.The screenshots of websites are stored in "Webss" file in main branch.                                 

2.The whole code, folders are in "Master" branch.
